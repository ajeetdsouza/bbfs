# bbfs

BBFS, aka the "Big Brother File System", is a simple FUSE filesystem that passes every operation down to an underlying directory. This is a Haskell port of BBFS, aimed at exploring the (yet-to-mature) FUSE bindings currently available in the Haskell ecosystem.

The original BBFS (implemented in C) can be found [here](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial/).
